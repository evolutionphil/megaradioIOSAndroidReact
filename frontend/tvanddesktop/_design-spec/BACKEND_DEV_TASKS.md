# 📨 Notes for the MegaRadio Backend Developer

> **From**: Frontend team (Apple TV / macOS / Android TV / Desktop expansion)
> **For**: Backend team (api.themegaradio.com maintainer)
> **Priority**: P1 — needed before TV apps go live in App Store / Play Store

The TV apps are now feature-complete on the client. The frontend changes you need
to support on the backend are **non-breaking** — every existing iOS / Android / web
client keeps working unchanged. Please add the items below at your convenience.

---

## 1. ✅ Cross-platform IAP Receipt Validation Endpoint  (P1 — REQUIRED)

The TV / Desktop apps reuse the **same product IDs** as the iOS / Android mobile apps:

| Product                 | Product ID (iOS + Android + tvOS + macOS) | Type            | Price     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Premium — monthly       | `megaradio_premium_monthly1`              | Auto-renew sub  | €3.99/mo  |
| Premium — yearly        | `megaradio_premium_yearly`                | Auto-renew sub  | €29.99/yr |
| Premium — lifetime      | `megaradio_premium_lifetime`              | Non-consumable  | €59.99    |
| Remove Ads — yearly     | `megaradio_remove_ads_yearly1`            | Auto-renew sub  | €29.99/yr |

### Endpoint spec

```http
POST /api/iap/validate
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <user_jwt>   (optional)

{
  "platform": "ios" | "android" | "tvos" | "macos",
  "productId": "megaradio_premium_yearly",
  "receipt": "<base64 receipt from StoreKit / Play Billing>",
  "userId": "<optional>"
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "expiresAt": 1735689600000,
  "originalTransactionId": "1000000847362819",
  "isLifetime": false,
  "productId": "megaradio_premium_yearly"
}
```

### Implementation hints

- **iOS / tvOS / macOS** → forward receipt to:
  - Production: `https://buy.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt`
  - Sandbox: `https://sandbox.itunes.apple.com/verifyReceipt`
  - Need: App-Specific Shared Secret (App Store Connect → MegaRadio → App Information)
- **Android** → use Google Play Developer API (`purchases.subscriptions.get` /
  `purchases.products.get`); needs a service-account JSON from Play Console.

**Why this matters**: Apple **requires** server-side receipt validation for
auto-renewing subs. Without this endpoint, App Review will reject the binary.

## 2. 🟢 Pal Station logo 404 (P3 — cosmetic, one-line fix)

URL `https://j5k7p3y4.stackpathcdn.com/.../pal-station.png` returns 404 in our logs.
Just rewrite the `favicon` field for that station document:

```js
db.stations.updateOne(
  { name: /Pal Station/i },
  { $set: { favicon: "https://api.themegaradio.com/cdn/pal-station.png" } }
)
```

(Or re-upload the logo to your existing CDN bucket.)

## ✅ Things you DON'T need to do

### ❌ ~~Now Playing metadata endpoint~~ — **NOT NEEDED**

Earlier draft asked for `GET /api/stations/:id/metadata`. **Cancel this.**

The TV / Desktop apps will read **ICY metadata directly from the audio stream**,
exactly like the iOS / Android mobile app already does via
`react-native-track-player`. The native shells (AVPlayer on tvOS/macOS,
ExoPlayer on Android TV, Node `http` module in Electron) extract `StreamTitle`
from the ICY frames and forward it to the WebView UI via a JS bridge.

So please **ignore** the now-playing 404s in the logs — those are stale calls
from the old code path. The new builds won't make these requests.

### ✅ CORS — already correct

`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is set on every endpoint. No action needed —
just don't accidentally remove it during refactors.

### ✅ TV login flow — already working

Existing `/api/auth/tv/code` and `/api/auth/tv/poll` endpoints work perfectly.

### ✅ Hero / paywall images — bundled in client

No backend hosting needed.

---

## TL;DR

You only need to do **two things**:

1. **Add `POST /api/iap/validate`** (P1 — blocks App Store submission)
2. **Update Pal Station `favicon`** in MongoDB (P3 — one update query)

Everything else is handled client-side or already works.

Thanks! 🙏
