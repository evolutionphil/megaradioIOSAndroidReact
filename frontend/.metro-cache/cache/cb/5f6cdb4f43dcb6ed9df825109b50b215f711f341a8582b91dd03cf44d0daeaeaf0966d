The\n     code lengths are lens[0..codes-1].  Each length corresponds to the\n     symbols 0..codes-1.  The Huffman code is generated by first sorting the\n     symbols by length from short to long, and retaining the symbol order\n     for codes with equal lengths.  Then the code starts with all zero bits\n     for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n     increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n     increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n     from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n     decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n     are incremented backwards.\n      This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n     lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n     1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n     symbol does not occur in this code.\n      The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n     creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n     sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n     table.  The sorted table is work[], with that space being provided by\n     the caller.\n      The length counts are used for other purposes as well, i.e. finding\n     the minimum and maximum length codes, determining if there are any\n     codes at all, checking for a valid set of lengths, and looking ahead\n     at length counts to determine sub-table sizes when building the\n     decoding tables.\n     */\n\n    /* accumulate lengths for codes (assumes lens[] all in 0..MAXBITS) */\n    for (len = 0; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n      count[len] = 0;\n    }\n    for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n      count[lens[lens_index + sym]]++;\n    }\n\n    /* bound code lengths, force root to be within code lengths */\n    root = bits;\n    for (max = MAXBITS; max >= 1; max--) {\n      if (count[max] !== 0) {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    if (root > max) {\n      root = max;\n    }\n    if (max === 0) {\n      /* no symbols to code at all */\n      //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;  //here.op = (var char)64;    /* invalid code marker */\n      //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;   //here.bits = (var char)1;\n      //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;   //here.val = (var short)0;\n      table[table_index++] = 1 << 24 | 64 << 16 | 0;\n\n      //table.op[opts.table_index] = 64;\n      //table.bits[opts.table_index] = 1;\n      //table.val[opts.table_index++] = 0;\n      table[table_index++] = 1 << 24 | 64 << 16 | 0;\n      opts.bits = 1;\n      return 0; /* no symbols, but wait for decoding to report error */\n    }\n    for (min = 1; min < max; min++) {\n      if (count[min] !== 0) {\n        break;\n      }\n    }\n    if (root < min) {\n      root = min;\n    }\n\n    /* check for an over-subscribed or incomplete set of lengths */\n    left = 1;\n    for (len = 1; len <= MAXBITS; len++) {\n      left <<= 1;\n      left -= count[len];\n      if (left < 0) {\n        return -1;\n      } /* over-subscribed */\n    }\n    if (left > 0 && (type === CODES || max !== 1)) {\n      return -1; /* incomplete set */\n    }\n\n    /* generate offsets into symbol table for each length for sorting */\n    offs[1] = 0;\n    for (len = 1; len < MAXBITS; len++) {\n      offs[len + 1] = offs[len] + count[len];\n    }\n\n    /* sort symbols by length, by symbol order within each length */\n    for (sym = 0; sym < codes; sym++) {\n      if (lens[lens_index + sym] !== 0) {\n        work[offs[lens[lens_index + sym]]++] = sym;\n      }\n    }\n\n    /*\n     Create and fill in decoding tables.  In this loop, the table being\n     filled is at next and has curr index bits.  The code being used is huff\n     with length len.  That code is converted to an index by dropping drop\n     bits off of the bottom.  For codes where len is less than drop + curr,\n     those top drop + curr - len bits are incremented through all values to\n     fill the table with replicated entries.\n      root is the number of index bits for the root table.  When len exceeds\n     root, sub-tables are created pointed to by the root entry with an index\n     of the low root bits of huff.  This is saved in low to check for when a\n     new sub-table should be started.  drop is zero when the root table is\n     being filled, and drop is root when sub-tables are being filled.\n      When a new sub-table is needed, it is necessary to look ahead in the\n     code lengths to determine what size sub-table is needed.  The length\n     counts are used for this, and so count[] is decremented as codes are\n     entered in the tables.\n      used keeps track of how many table entries have been allocated from the\n     provided *table space.
