<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a production-ready mobile radio streaming app called MegaRadio using React Native with Expo. The user's primary and most critical requirement is that the application's UI must be a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma designs they provide. The backend API is available at .

The current focus is on building UI components as requested by the user, including a complete token-based authentication flow (Login, Signup, Forgot Password), an animated splash screen, and a set of onboarding screens to be shown on first launch.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Role:** Senior React Native + Expo Architect.
- **Tech Stack:** Expo, TypeScript, EAS Build, Expo Router, Zustand, React Query, Axios, , .
- **Core Features:**
    - **UI:** A pixel-perfect implementation of provided Figma designs.
    - **Streaming:** Robust in-app playback.
    - **User Features:** Favorites, Recently Played, Profile (Followers/Following).
- **Authentication:** All API requests must include . A token-based user authentication system is now implemented.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
The application has a fully functional token-based authentication flow (Login, Signup, Forgot Password) that has been connected to the backend and verified by the testing agent. Several UI adjustments have been completed based on specific user feedback for the auth and profile screens.

A complex, fully animated splash screen has been created using  and is displayed for 2.8 seconds on app startup. This was built from separate image assets (logo, circles, dots pattern) to allow for individual animations (pulse, fade, wave), as requested by the user.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user requested the creation of a set of onboarding screens that must appear after the splash screen and only on the first launch of the application. The user provided an image for the first onboarding screen. The agent acknowledged the request and was preparing to download the assets and begin implementation.
- **Status**: NOT STARTED
- **Agent Testing Done**: N
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: screenshot tool (to verify UI) and manual testing (to verify the show once logic using ).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Car Mode Incorrect Station Logic (P1)**: Car Mode shows the wrong station on entry; it doesn't center the currently playing station.
- **Issue 2: Glow Effect Incorrect (P1)**: The Glow effect is visually incorrect, appearing as a solid shape instead of a soft glow.
- **Issue 3: Static Equalizer (P2)**: The equalizer on the player screen is static.
- **Issue 4: Sleep Timer Bug (P2)**: The sleep timer does not resume playback correctly after being stopped.

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1: Car Mode Incorrect Station Logic**
    - **Attempted fixes**: None in this session.
    - **Next debug checklist**: Investigate the logic in the Car Mode component that determines which station to display upon entry. Check how the currently playing station state is being passed to and used by this component.
    - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?**: Provides a seamless user experience in Car Mode.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
- **(Other issues repeat the pattern above)**

**In progress Task List**:
- **Task 1: Implement Onboarding Screens (P0)**
    - **Description**: Build a multi-screen onboarding flow that appears after the splash screen. This flow must only be displayed the very first time a user opens the app.
    - **Where to resume**:
        1. Download the image assets provided by the user for the onboarding screens.
        2. Create a new component (e.g., ) to manage the flow, likely using a  with  or a similar pager component.
        3. Implement logic using  to set a flag (e.g., ) after the user finishes the flow.
        4. Update  to conditionally render the  component based on the  flag after the splash screen finishes.
    - **What will be achieved with this?**: A guided introduction for new users, improving the first-time user experience.
    - **Status**: NOT STARTED
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
**Upcoming Tasks:**
-   **P0: Finalize Profile Sub-Screens**: Populate  with data and implement logic in .
-   **P1: Implement Follow/Unfollow Functionality**: Connect UI buttons to the live API endpoints.

**Future Tasks:**
-   Integrate  for full internationalization.
-   Add skeleton loaders for data-fetching states.
-   Implement Google Sign-In using the  endpoint.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Full Authentication Flow (DONE)**: The entire mobile authentication system (Login, Signup, Forgot Password) was connected to the backend API and fully tested. This included debugging an incorrect registration endpoint () and replacing it with the correct one ().
- **Animated Splash Screen (DONE)**: Created a complex animated splash screen () with pulsing circles, a scaling logo, and a waving dots pattern, exactly matching user specifications.
- **UI Adjustments (DONE)**:
    - **Auth Options**: Replaced the old logo with a new, larger, and repositioned image.
    - **Profile Page**: Updated the guest user view by changing button text (Sign In / Sign Up) and removing redundant elements.
    - **Signup Page**: Made the title bold and perfectly centered the password hint text according to the user's screenshot.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
- **Issue 1: Vector Icon Rendering on Web**
    - **Debug checklist**: The root cause of  not rendering on the web platform was never identified. The workaround was to use local image assets for all icons.
    - **Why to solve this issue and what will be achieved with this?**: To enable the use of a standard, scalable icon library and avoid managing a large number of individual image files.
    - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    - **Is recurring issue?**: Y

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
- **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: Car Mode incorrect station logic and Glow Effect visual bug.
- **Recurrence count**: 3
- **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Animated UI**: Extensive use of  to create complex, performant animations for the splash screen. The next agent should be comfortable with this library for the onboarding transitions.
-   **First-Launch Logic**: The upcoming task requires using  to persist a state flag () across app sessions to control the visibility of the onboarding flow.

**key DB schema**
- No changes to the database schema in this session.

**changes in tech stack**
- No changes to the tech stack.  was used but was already a dependency.

**All files of reference**

-    (Modified to orchestrate splash and main app)
-    (Modified for UI update)
-    (Modified for UI update)
-    (Modified for UI update)
-    (Modified to use correct signup endpoint)

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- The state management in  (e.g., ) is becoming complex. As the onboarding flow logic is added, consider abstracting this app state (e.g., , ) into a dedicated context provider or a Zustand store to keep the root layout component clean.

**key api endpoints**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Immediate Task**: Your highest priority is to build the onboarding flow. It must appear after the animated splash screen and only on the first app launch. Use  to manage this show once state.
-   **User Language is Turkish**: The user communicates exclusively in Turkish. You **must** respond in Turkish.
-   **Animation is Expected**: The user requested detailed animations for the splash screen. Expect similar requirements for transitions in the onboarding flow.
-   **Pixel-Perfect from Images**: All UI work is driven by images provided by the user. Adhere to them strictly.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-    (Updated)
-    (New report from testing the full auth flow)
