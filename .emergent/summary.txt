<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a production-ready mobile radio streaming app called MegaRadio using React Native with Expo. The user's primary and most critical requirement is that the application's UI must be a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma designs they provide.

The initial scope included implementing a token-based authentication flow, an animated splash screen, and a set of onboarding screens. The scope has since expanded to include a global font update, UI animations, and social login integrations. The backend API is available at .

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Role:** Senior React Native + Expo Architect.
- **Tech Stack:** Expo, TypeScript, EAS Build, Expo Router, Zustand, React Query, Axios, , .
- **Core Features:**
    - **UI:** A pixel-perfect implementation of provided Figma designs.
    - **Font:** The entire application must use the  font family.
    - **Streaming:** Robust in-app playback.
    - **User Features:** Favorites, Recently Played, Profile (Followers/Following).
    - **Authentication:** All API requests must include . A token-based user authentication system is in place, and the user has requested Social Sign-In (Google/Apple/Facebook) and wants to ensure authentication works across all platforms (web, mobile, TV).
- **Design:** Login and Onboarding screens must be full-screen, not pop-ups. Onboarding screens should have animated transitions.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
The application has a 3-screen onboarding flow that is displayed on the first launch. The UI has been updated to meet the user's design specifications, including full-screen background images, a linear gradient overlay, and animated slide/fade transitions between screens.

A global font theme has been implemented, ensuring the  font family is used across the application, specifically in the onboarding, login, and signup screens.

The Follow/Unfollow functionality has been implemented on the user profile page (), allowing a user to follow or unfollow another user.

A critical bug in Car Mode has been fixed, ensuring the currently playing station is always correctly displayed when entering this mode.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working**: The user asked if the backend API supports cross-platform authentication (i.e., a user account created on one platform is accessible on all others). The agent was in the process of investigating the API documentation at  to answer this question. This is a prerequisite for implementing the P0 social login task.
- **Status**: IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done**: N/A
- **Which testing method agent to use?**: manual testing by curl (to test API endpoints if needed after investigation).
- **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Investigate API for Cross-Platform Authentication (P0)**
- **Issue 2: Glow Effect Incorrect (P1)**
- **Issue 3: Static Equalizer (P2)**
- **Issue 4: Sleep Timer Bug (P2)**
- **Issue 5: Vector Icon Rendering on Web (P2)**

**Issues Detail**:
- **Issue 1: Investigate API for Cross-Platform Authentication**
    - **Attempted fixes**: The agent started to investigate the API documentation provided by the user.
    - **Next debug checklist**:
        1.  Complete the review of the API documentation at .
        2.  Identify endpoints related to social login (, etc.) and standard JWT login.
        3.  Determine if a single user identity is created regardless of the authentication method or platform.
        4.  Report the findings to the user and confirm if the API supports their requirement or if backend changes are needed.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **Immediate Task**: Your first priority is to complete the investigation of the API documentation at . You need to determine if the API supports a unified user identity across different platforms and login methods (JWT, Social). Report your findings to the user in **Turkish**. This task blocks the user's P0 priority.
- **User Language is Turkish**: You **must** respond to the user in Turkish.
- **Blocked Issues**: The Glow Effect and Sleep Timer bugs are blocked pending more specific details from the user. After you report on the API investigation, you should ask the user for clarification on these items so you can address them.
- **Priorities**: After the API investigation, the user's priorities are:
    1.  **P0:** Implement Google/Apple/Facebook Sign-In.
    2.  **P1:** Populate profile sub-screens (, ) with real data.
    3.  **P2:** Fix the remaining bugs (Glow Effect, Equalizer, Sleep Timer).

**documents and test reports created in this job**
-  was updated.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
- **User (LATEST):** Asked if the API supports cross-platform authentication (same account for web/mobile/TV) and provided a link to the API documentation for investigation. **Status: IN PROGRESS.**
- **User:** Requested animations for onboarding screens and approved the plan to work on a prioritized list of features/bugs (Social login, profile data, other bugs). **Status: Partially Completed (Animation done, rest are pending).**
- **User:** Provided specific font requirements (, weights, sizes) and confirmed that login/auth screens must be full-screen. **Status: Completed.**

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:**
    - Glow Effect is visually incorrect.
    - Equalizer is static.
    - Sleep Timer may have a bug.
    - Vector Icons do not render correctly on the web.

- **Known regressions:** None

**Credentials to test flow:**
- **API Key**:  (to be sent in the  header for all backend requests).

**What agent forgot to execute**
- The agent was interrupted while investigating the API documentation and has not yet provided an answer to the user's critical question about cross-platform authentication.
- The agent did not ask the user for more details on the Glow Effect and Sleep Timer bugs after identifying them as blocked, which would be a necessary step to unblock them.</analysis>
